Stop scrolling, save time! Have the admin menu stay in place, no matter how far you scroll down.


== Description ==

Stop scrolling, save time! Have the admin menu stay in place, no matter how long the page may be and you happen to have scrolled.

The WordPress admin menu is floating (sticky; fixed) *as long as the viewport of the browser is taller than the admin menu itself*, otherwise it reverts to it's default behavior, glued to the top of the backend. The floating can be disabled on a per user basis under profile settings. Mobile devices (except iPads) are currently not supported.
